# ReptileDB - database

The ReptileDB project consists of three different components:

1. Database - the raw data itself and the code to push it to a database,
2. API - the middleware API for bridging the backend database with the front-end, and
3. Front End - the application that presents and manages the data.

This repo contains the database.

*./data* - contains the data file snapshots as provided by Peter Uetz.
*./src* - contains the code to transform and load the data into the database.
*./docs* - contains the output reports documenting the process for sharing on github.io

This project was originally created as part of VCU Senior Design/Capstone project 24-307.
